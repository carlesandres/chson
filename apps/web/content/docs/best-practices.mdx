Follow these guidelines to create cheatsheets that are easy to scan and use.

## When to Use Labels

Add a `label` field when the anchor isn't immediately clear:

- **Keyboard shortcuts** — `ctrl + shift + p`
- **Vim/editor commands** — `gg`, `dd`, `ciw`
- **Abbreviated commands** — `git stash pop` might need context
- **Symbols or codes** — Any anchor that isn't self-explanatory

```json
{
  "anchor": "gg",
  "content": "Jump to visual top of history",
  "label": "Go to start"
}
```

If the anchor is self-explanatory (like `git status`), skip the label.

## Choosing Retrieval Direction

| Direction              | Use When                                          | Example Question                |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `mechanism-to-meaning` | Users know the command, want to know what it does | "What does `git rebase -i` do?" |
| `intent-to-mechanism`  | Users know the goal, want to find the command     | "How do I squash commits?"      |

**Default to `mechanism-to-meaning`** for most cheatsheets (command references, shortcuts). Use `intent-to-mechanism` when users will primarily search by goal.

## Structuring Sections

### Do

- **Group by functionality**, not alphabetically
- **Put common operations first** — Most-used commands at the top
- **Use section descriptions** to provide context when needed
- **Keep sections focused** — Split large sections into smaller ones

### Don't

- Don't create sections with only 1-2 entries (combine them)
- Don't use vague section titles like "Other" or "Misc"
- Don't alphabetize within sections (group by workflow instead)

## Column Label Conventions

Choose labels that match your content type:

| Cheatsheet Type             | anchorLabel | contentLabel |
| --------------------------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| Keyboard shortcuts          | Shortcut    | Action       |
| CLI commands                | Command     | Description  |
| CLI with examples           | Example     | Description  |
| Configuration               | Option      | Description  |
| Configuration with defaults | Option      | Default      |
| Glossaries                  | Term        | Definition   |
| API reference               | Endpoint    | Description  |

## File Naming

Use kebab-case for cheatsheet files:

```
cheatsheets/
├── git/
│   ├── core.chson.json
│   └── advanced.chson.json
├── docker/
│   └── core.chson.json
└── atuin/
    └── keybindings.chson.json
```

## Schema Reference

Always include the schema URL for IDE support:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://chson.dev/schema/v2/chson.schema.json",
  "title": "My Cheatsheet",
  ...
}
```

This enables:

- Autocompletion in VS Code, WebStorm, etc.
- Inline validation errors
- Hover documentation
