description: A JSON format for software cheatsheets, designed around how people actually look up information.

ChSON (Cheatsheet JSON) is a small JSON format for writing software cheatsheets in a consistent, tool-friendly way.

## Why ChSON?

The goal is simple: write a cheatsheet once, then consume it anywhere—searchable websites, printable pages, study decks, or personal knowledge bases.

The v2 format is designed around **cognitive retrieval theory**: how people actually scan and look up information.

## Core Concepts

Every cheatsheet entry has two key parts:

- **anchor** — The retrieval cue. What you scan for. (command, shortcut, keyword)
- **content** — The information you need when you find it. (description, action, result)

Think of it like a dictionary: you scan for the word (anchor) to find its definition (content).
