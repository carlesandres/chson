ChSON (Cheatsheet JSON) is a small JSON format for writing software cheatsheets in a consistent, tool-friendly way. The goal is simple: write a cheatsheet once, then consume it anywhere—searchable websites, printable pages, study decks, or personal knowledge bases.

## Why ChSON?

The v2 format is designed around **cognitive retrieval theory**: how people actually scan and look up information. When you use a cheatsheet, you typically scan for something you recognize (a command, shortcut, or keyword) to find the information you need.

## Quick Start

Every cheatsheet entry has two key parts:

- **anchor** — The retrieval cue. What you scan for.
- **content** — The information you need when you find it.

```json
{
  "anchor": "git status",
  "content": "Show staged, unstaged, and untracked files."
}
```

Think of it like a dictionary: you scan for the word (anchor) to find its definition (content).
