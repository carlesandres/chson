Every cheatsheet entry has two key parts that mirror how people actually look up information.

## Anchor and Content

- **anchor** — The retrieval cue. What you scan for. (command, shortcut, keyword)
- **content** — The information you need when you find it. (description, action, result)

Think of it like a dictionary: you scan for the word (anchor) to find its definition (content).

```json title="Basic entry"
{
  "anchor": "git status",
  "content": "Show staged, unstaged, and untracked files."
}
```

## Optional Labels

Sometimes the anchor is cryptic—a keyboard shortcut, obscure command, or symbol. The optional `label` field provides a human-readable description.

```json title="Entry with label"
{
  "anchor": "gg",
  "content": "Jump to visual top of history",
  "label": "Go to start"
}
```

Labels are useful for:

- Vim commands (`gg`, `dd`, `ciw`)
- Keyboard shortcuts (`ctrl + shift + p`)
- Any anchor that isn't immediately self-explanatory

## Sections

Entries are organized into sections, each with a title and optional description. Sections group related entries logically—by functionality, context, or workflow.

```json title="Section structure"
{
  "sections": [
    {
      "title": "Navigation",
      "description": "Moving around the interface.",
      "entries": [
        { "anchor": "ctrl + n", "content": "Next item" },
        { "anchor": "ctrl + p", "content": "Previous item" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
