## Anchor and Content

Every cheatsheet entry has two key parts:

- **anchor** — The retrieval cue. What you scan for.
- **content** — The information you need when you find it.

```json
{
  "anchor": "git status",
  "content": "Show staged, unstaged, and untracked files."
}
```

## Optional Labels

Sometimes the anchor is cryptic—a keyboard shortcut, obscure command, or symbol. The optional `label` field provides a human-readable description.

```json
{
  "anchor": "gg",
  "content": "Jump to visual top of history",
  "label": "Go to start"
}
```

Labels are useful for vim commands, keyboard shortcuts, or any anchor that isn't immediately self-explanatory.

## Sections

Entries are organized into sections, each with a title and optional description.

```json
{
  "sections": [
    {
      "title": "Navigation",
      "description": "Moving around the interface.",
      "entries": [
        { "anchor": "ctrl + n", "content": "Next item" },
        { "anchor": "ctrl + p", "content": "Previous item" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
