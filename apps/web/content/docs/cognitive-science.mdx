# Cognitive Science Background

ChSON isn't just a convenient format—it's designed based on principles from cognitive psychology, memory science, and human-computer interaction. This page summarizes the theoretical foundations that inform ChSON's structure.

  Cheatsheets](https://github.com/carlesandres/chson/blob/main/research/cognitive-foundations.md),

## Why This Matters

Software cheatsheets exist in countless forms, yet no systematic theory has explained:

1. **Why** cheatsheets are cognitively effective
2. **What** structural properties make some cheatsheets better than others
3. **How** different types of content should be organized differently

ChSON's design choices are grounded in answers to these questions.

## Core Insight: The Anchor-Content Structure

Consider two common cheatsheet layouts:

**Programming cheatsheet (Git):**
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `git commit -m "msg"` | Create a commit with message |

**Keyboard shortcut cheatsheet (VS Code):**
| Action | Shortcut |
|--------|----------|
| Save file | Cmd+S |

The columns appear "reversed." Why?

Both layouts follow the same underlying principle:

> **The left column contains what the user knows (the retrieval anchor); the right column contains what they need (the associated content).**

This is why ChSON uses the terms **anchor** and **content** rather than "command/description" or "key/value"—they're neutral terms that apply to any retrieval direction.

## Theoretical Foundations

### Cheatsheets as Extended Mind

Clark and Chalmers' **Extended Mind Thesis** (1998) argues that cognitive processes extend beyond the brain into the environment. Cheatsheets function as **cognitive offloading devices**:

- They reduce demands on working memory
- They externalize retrieval to a reliable artifact
- They become part of the practitioner's cognitive system

A cheatsheet isn't just a learning aid—it's a functional extension of the user's memory.

### The Cue-Target Structure

The fundamental unit of a cheatsheet is a **paired associate**: two pieces of information linked together, where one serves as a retrieval cue for the other.

| Memory Term           | Cheatsheet Role        |
| --------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Cue** (stimulus)    | Left column (anchor)   |
| **Target** (response) | Right column (content) |

The memory research distinguishes **forward recall** (A → B) from **backward recall** (B → A). Different cheatsheet types optimize for different directions.

### Chunking and Templates

Miller (1956) established that working memory holds approximately 7±2 "chunks" of information. Chase and Simon (1973) showed that expert chess players' superior memory came from recognizing positions as familiar **chunks** rather than individual pieces.

**Implications for cheatsheets:**

1. The anchor often represents a **chunk** or **template pattern**
2. Well-designed entries match the user's existing chunk vocabulary
3. For novices, cheatsheets _teach_ new chunks; for experts, they _remind_ of rarely-used ones
4. Slot notation (e.g., `git commit -m "<message>"`) maps directly to template theory

### Information Foraging

Pirolli and Card's **Information Foraging Theory** (1999) models how humans seek information using concepts from optimal foraging:

- **Information scent**: Cues indicating useful information ahead
- **Information patch**: A resource (section, page) as an information source
- **Informavores**: Humans optimizing information-seeking behavior

Cheatsheet users are foragers scanning for the right entry. The anchor column provides **information scent**; stronger scent leads to faster, more accurate retrieval.

**Design implication**: Anchors must provide strong, unambiguous scent:

- Code in monospace is more distinctive than prose
- Visual formatting (bold, boxes) aids scanning
- Consistent structure enables pattern matching

### Cognitive Load Theory

Sweller's **Cognitive Load Theory** (1988) distinguishes three types of load:

| Load Type                           | Cheatsheet Effect                     |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Intrinsic** (material complexity) | Unchanged                             |
| **Extraneous** (poor presentation)  | **Reduced** by good design            |
| **Germane** (schema construction)   | **Enabled** by freeing working memory |

Cheatsheets reduce extraneous load by:

- Pre-organizing information (no search required)
- Consistent formatting (reduces parsing effort)
- Proximity of related information (reduces split attention)

### Dual Coding Theory

Paivio's **Dual Coding Theory** (1971) proposes separate channels for verbal and visual information:

- **Logogens**: Units for verbal information
- **Imagens**: Units for visual/spatial information

The **picture superiority effect** shows that distinctive visual elements are remembered better than text alone.

**Cheatsheet implication**: Code, commands, and shortcuts should be visually distinctive (monospace, highlighting, icons). This creates a second retrieval pathway.

---

## Retrieval Directions

Different cheatsheet types optimize for different retrieval directions based on what users know vs. need.

### Intent → Mechanism

User knows: **What they want to accomplish**  
User needs: **How to accomplish it**

```
"How do I save?" → Cmd+S
```

### Mechanism → Meaning

User knows: **A command or syntax they've seen**  
User needs: **What it does**

```
git stash → "Temporarily store changes"
```

### Content Type Mapping

| Content Type             | Primary Direction   |
| ------------------------ | ------------------- |
| Keyboard shortcuts       | Intent → Mechanism  |
| CLI commands (learning)  | Intent → Mechanism  |
| CLI commands (reference) | Mechanism → Meaning |
| API reference            | Mechanism → Meaning |
| Config options           | Mechanism → Meaning |
| Concepts/glossary        | Term → Definition   |

## Design Principles

Based on these foundations, ChSON follows these design principles:

### Structural Principles

**Consistent retrieval direction**  
All entries within a section should share the same retrieval direction. Mixing directions creates scanning confusion.

**Strong scent in anchors**  
Retrieval anchors should be visually distinctive and semantically precise.

**Atomic entries**  
Each entry should capture one chunk. Multi-step procedures may need decomposition.

**Slot notation for templates**  
Variable components should use consistent placeholder notation (e.g., `<file>`, `{name}`).

### Cognitive Load Principles

**Minimize split attention**  
Keep anchor and content visually proximate. Two-column tables excel at this.

**Consistent formatting**  
Visual consistency reduces parsing effort.

**Progressive disclosure**  
Common entries first; advanced options later.

### Chunking Principles

**Match user vocabulary**  
Anchors should use terms the target audience already knows.

**Group by semantic category**  
Sections should reflect conceptual chunks, not alphabetical order.

**Reasonable section size**  
Sections should be scannable at a glance. 10-15 entries is acceptable when visually consistent.

## ChSON Schema Alignment

The ChSON v2 schema directly implements this theoretical framework:

| ChSON Element        | Cognitive Role                             |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `entry.anchor`       | Retrieval anchor                           |
| `entry.content`      | Associated content                         |
| `entry.label`        | Human-readable label for cryptic anchors   |
| `section.title`      | Chunk category label                       |
| `section.entries`    | Entries within a chunk                     |
| `retrievalDirection` | Explicit declaration of lookup direction   |
| `anchorLabel`        | Domain-appropriate name for anchor column  |
| `contentLabel`       | Domain-appropriate name for content column |

## Glossary

| Term                    | Definition                                                         |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Retrieval Anchor**    | The element users scan for; triggers recognition and retrieval     |
| **Associated Content**  | The information retrieved once an anchor is recognized             |
| **Retrieval Direction** | The implicit query direction: what the user knows → what they need |
| **Chunk**               | A familiar pattern recognized as a cognitive unit                  |
| **Information Scent**   | Visual or semantic cues indicating useful information ahead        |
| **Slot Pattern**        | An anchor containing variable placeholders                         |
| **Template**            | A chunk with slots that can be filled with specific values         |
