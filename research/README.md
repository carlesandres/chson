### [Cognitive Foundations](./cognitive-foundations.md)

A theoretical framework for understanding why cheatsheets work as cognitive tools.
Synthesizes research from memory science, cognitive load theory, information
foraging, and distributed cognition to propose:

- **Retrieval Anchor / Associated Content** terminology for cheatsheet structure
- A taxonomy of **retrieval directions** (intent→mechanism vs. mechanism→meaning)
- Design principles grounded in established cognitive theories
- Implications for the ChSON schema

**Status**: Working draft

## Future Research Directions

- [ ] Empirical validation via eye-tracking studies
- [ ] Survey of existing cheatsheet formats and their cognitive properties
- [ ] Design heuristics with testable predictions
- [ ] Integration with ChSON schema (explicit retrieval direction, anchor types)
