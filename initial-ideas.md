applications (web, CLI, desktop, etc) and registries that can hold, manipulate,
present, enhance and create those cheatsheets.

- Create a vocabulary for talking about cheatsheets

- Bring the vocabulary of neuroscience and learning to cheatsheets and
evangelise why cheatsheets are a great way to learn software
  - See [research/cognitive-foundations.md](./research/cognitive-foundations.md)
    for theoretical framework





- Make cheatsheets: structured, easy to ready, easy to



## Potential applications
